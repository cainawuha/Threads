public void run()
You’re going to put all the work the thread does in this one method. This method may invoke other methods; it may construct other objects; it may even spawn other threads.
However, the thread starts here and it stops here. When the run() method completes, the thread dies.

 public class DigestThread extends Thread {}
If you subclass Thread, you should override run() and nothing else! 
The various other methods of the Thread class—for example, start(), interrupt(), join(), sleep(), and so on—all have very specific semantics with the virtual machine 
you should not replace any of the other standard Thread methods.
